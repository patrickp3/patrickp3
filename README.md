- 👋 Hi, I’m @patrickp3
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to implement two factor authentication in my PHP, HTML, MySql project I'm hosting on my Apache Webserver local host.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about two factor authenticaion implementations available such as Google Authenticator, etc.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on how to implement my own at a low level, instead of an API developed by a 3rd party.
- 📫 You can reach me through discussions on GitHub.
